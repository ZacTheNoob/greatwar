        During WW1 there were alot of threats and these were very dangerous especially that they couldnt run away from  the danger. <br>
        These could vary from bombs, gas, flamethrowers, tanks. Most of the fighting happened at night and this gave time <br>
        during the day to do their duties and anything else. Millions of people died in the trenches from these things <br>
        but both sides used these things.
