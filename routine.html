<p>In the trenches the soldiers had duties such as digging more trench out, making sure the dugouts arent crumbling,<br>
clean weapons, posting letters. After they had completed their duties they had nothing to do <br>
so a lot of soldiers would have just slept in the dug outs or they would write letetrs. <br>
The reason they got so bored is that most of the fighting happenesd at night time so during <br>
the day they had nothing else to do until night time. Here are some images of boredom in war. <br>
