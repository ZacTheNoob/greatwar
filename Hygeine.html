    <p>During the Great War there were alot of hygeine issues such as Rats and lice, <br>
    they couldnt get the lice out when they wanted as they could only change once every few weeks. <br>
A method to get the lice out is to burn them so the soldiers got lighters to burn the lice off. <br>
The rats often carried diseases and they also carried lice which spread the lice everywhere and disease.
